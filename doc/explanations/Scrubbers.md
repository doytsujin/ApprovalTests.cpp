## Introduction

![Scrubber Overview](/doc/images/ScrubberOverview.png?raw=true)

If you are having trouble getting tests running reproducibly, you might need to use a "scrubber" to convert the non-deterministic text to something stable.

## Interface

Fundamentally, a scrubber is function that takes a string and returns a string. You can create ones by passing in a function or a lambda. We also have some pre-made ones for your convenience.

## How to use Scrubbers

You can scrub text manually, before passing it in to Approvals::verify(), but the preferred method is to include a
Scrubber as an option.

```cpp
Approvals::verify(input, Options().withScrubber(scrubber));

## Scrubber concepts

There are several patterns that are commonly used when scrubbing:

* Replace troublesome text
* Replace troublesome text, tracking duplicates
* Combining scrubbers
* Deleting troublesome lines
